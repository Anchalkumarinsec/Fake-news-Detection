# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

Developed a multi-model Machine Learning system to classify news articles as **Fake** or **Real** using Natural Language Processing techniques.

## 🚀 Key Highlights
- Performed text preprocessing and noise reduction
- Applied TF-IDF vectorization (3000 features)
- Implemented and compared 4 models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Random Forest
- Evaluated performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall & F1-Score
- Built a manual testing function for real-time prediction

## 🛠 Tech Stack
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-learn | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Google Colab

## 🎯 Impact
Demonstrates strong understanding of NLP preprocessing, feature engineering, model comparison, and practical ML implementation.
